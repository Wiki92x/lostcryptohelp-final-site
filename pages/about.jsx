          <li>
            <strong>Deep Wallet Scans:</strong> Our scanner inspects wallet addresses across Ethereum, BNB, and TRON chains using real-time data APIs.

          <li>
            <strong>Smart Payment Verification:</strong> Before generating a report, the system automatically checks if a valid crypto payment (minimum $0.50 USD equivalent) has been sent.

            <strong>Submit Report:</strong> Users can submit their case anonymously. The report is instantly sent to our backend Telegram bot for analyst review.
